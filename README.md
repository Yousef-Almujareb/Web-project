# Web-project

Well firstly, the idea of the project is to help students.

The project contains 3 main parts, couldn't finish any of them. However I have the first 2 options as C code that I did 1 month ago it's included in the file. I couldn't finish due to two reasons one because I started at 21-12 second reason because I didn't attend the classes :) 

Anyway I'm greatful that I was student here and I've gained decent knowledge about HTML,CSS and JS.

The 3 main parts:

1- GPA calculator as mentioned in the website
it calculates the GPA according to the creidts and grades the user enters.

2- Graduation calculator
it calculates when the student is going to graduate after entering the credits done and the total credits needed, then he can enter for each course the credits he's going to take until graduation. 

The 2nd part of Graduation calculator is just entering the minimum and maximum credits per course and it's calculate the fastest course to graduate!

3- Schedule 
it allows the user to plan for the next course, and get the optimum schedule he can get by entering the name of the subject and time and it gets created in the table then he can remove and add multiple times.

Finally,
Thank you & I'm sorry I couldn't finish it!
